Welcome to **rust-100**, a wiki of 100 bite-sized Rust lessons to get you moving quickly. Please go to [the wiki](https://github.com/rpivo/rust-100/wiki/1:-Checking-the-Currently-Installed-Version-of-Rust-&-Rustup) for the first lesson.

This wiki closely follows the official Rust Programming Language book, [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The book is much more thorough and complete than this wiki. This wiki is meant to be a quick reference for learning Rust.
