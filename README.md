# rust-100
### [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) in 100 bite-sized lessons.

Welcome to **rust-100**, a wiki of 100 bite-sized Rust lessons to get you moving quickly. Please go to [the wiki](https://github.com/rpivo/rust-100/wiki/1:-Checking-the-Currently-Installed-Version-of-Rust-&-Rustup) for a list of lessons.

This wiki closely follows the official Rust Programming Language book, [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). The book is much more thorough and complete than this wiki. This wiki is meant to be a quick reference for learning Rust.

While working through the lessons, [the Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/) is a great place to experiment with Rust code. It's a simple web app that allows you to write Rust code and see the results immediately.
